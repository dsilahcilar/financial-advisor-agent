## Foundational Execution Principles

- Prioritize **measured entry** based on validated positive signals such as earnings strength and regulatory clarity.
- Maintain **disciplined risk controls** to protect capital.
- Adopt a **patient hold** approach to benefit from NVIDIA’s secular growth in AI and data centers.
- Integrate **fundamental triggers** with **market mechanics** to ensure alignment with a moderate risk profile and long-term holding.

### Constraints

- Allow **patience** during market volatility; monitor key fundamentals to adjust exposure if secular trends weaken.

---

## Entry Strategy

### Optimal Entry

- Enter **on a stable or modest pullback** after:
  - Strong quarterly earnings reports, or
  - Clear resolution/improvement in export restrictions affecting China sales.

- Ensure entry aligns with **positive fundamental momentum**.

### Timing

- Preferably **shortly after earnings releases** confirming:
  - Data center revenue growth > 70% YoY, or
  - Regulatory updates providing clarity.

- Capitalize on **reduced uncertainty** and improved price stability.

### Order Types

- Use **limit orders** near identified pullback levels.
- Monitor **volume and price action** to confirm stability before executing.

### Position Sizing

- Deploy an initial position of **5-10%** of the portfolio.
- Balance exposure with risk tolerance and long-term commitment.

### Stop-Loss

- Implement a **wider, fundamental-based stop loss**:
  - Example: 15-20% trailing stop, or
  - Conditional stop triggered by deterioration in revenue growth or regulatory environment.
- Avoid tight stops to prevent premature exits due to normal volatility.

---

## In-Trade Management

### Monitoring

- Establish a **routine review cadence** post-earnings and major regulatory news.
- Track key indicators:
  - Data center revenue growth
  - AI demand metrics
  - Export restrictions

### Risk Management

- Continuously monitor:
  - Quarterly earnings
  - Regulatory developments
  - AI market trends
- Adjust **stop loss levels** and **position sizing** accordingly.
- Tighten stops if:
  - Revenue growth drops below 20% YoY, or
  - Regulatory risks escalate.

### Handling Drawdowns

- Accept **normal price volatility** inherent in tech stocks.
- Use **wider stops** and avoid reactive selling on short-term dips unless **fundamentals deteriorate**.

---

## Accumulation Strategy

### Conditions for Adding

- Continue to add when:
  - Quarterly earnings show **>70% YoY revenue growth**, and
  - AI demand remains **robust**, or
  - Regulatory headwinds **eases significantly**.

### Execution

- Scale in **gradually** using **limit orders** on minor pullbacks or consolidations.
- Aim to **optimize average cost basis** without overexposing during volatile periods.

### Risk Adjustment

- Increase **position size cautiously**.
- Keep total exposure within **moderate risk limits**.
- Adjust **stops** to **protect gains** as the position grows.

---

## Partial Sell Strategy

### Triggers for Partial Sells

- Revenue growth **slows below 20% YoY**.
- Regulatory risks **materially impact sales or inventory**.
- Valuations **reach levels inconsistent** with growth assumptions.

### Execution

- Use **limit orders** to execute partial sales when:
  - Revenue growth declines sharply, or
  - Regulatory risks increase.
- Consider **selling after significant price appreciation** to lock in gains while maintaining exposure.

### Remaining Position

- Retain a **core holding** to benefit from long-term secular growth.
- **Adjust stops upward** to protect unrealized gains and reduce downside risk.

---

## Full Exit Strategy

### Profit Exit

- Consider **full exit** if:
  - The broader tech sector undergoes a **significant valuation correction** that diminishes NVIDIA’s growth premium.
  - Fundamental **AI/cloud demand trends reverse materially**.

### Loss Exit

- Fully exit if:
  - Revenue growth **persistently drops below 20% YoY**, or
  - Regulatory/export restrictions cause **prolonged, material sales disruptions** leading to inventory write-downs and earnings impairment.

### Execution

- Use **limit orders** for systematic exits.
- Plan to **exit during stable market conditions**.
- Avoid panic selling; execute once **exit criteria are clearly met**.

### Slippage Management

- Use **staggered limit orders** to reduce slippage risk.
- Ensure **minimized market impact**, especially in volatile markets.
